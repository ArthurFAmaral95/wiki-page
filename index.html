        <p>
          <strong>Cruzeiro Esporte Clube</strong>, known simply as
          <strong>Cruzeiro</strong>, is a Brazilian sports club based in
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belo_Horizonte" target="_blank"
            >Belo Horizonte</a
          >,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minas_Gerais" target="_blank"
            >Minas Gerais</a
          >. Although they compete in a number of different sports, Cruzeiro is
          mostly known for its association football team. It plays in the
          Campeonato Brasileiro, as well as in the Campeonato Mineiro, the state
          of Minas Gerais's premier state league. It’s the biggest club in the
          state, followed by rivals Atlético MG and America - MG.
        </p>
        <p>
          The club was founded on 2 January 1921, by sportsmen from the Italian
          colony of Belo Horizonte, some members of Yale Atlético Clube and many
          Italian immigrant workers decided to create a new club called Societá
          Sportiva Ypiranga, changing the name months later to Palestra Mineiro
          and after one game to Palestra Itália. As a result of the Second World
          War, the Brazilian federal government banned the use of any symbols
          referring to the Axis powers in 1942. The club board members
          rebaptized the club with the name of a leading national symbol: the
          Cruzeiro do Sul's constellation. Cruzeiro play their home games at the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineirão" target="_blank"
            >Mineirão</a
          >
          stadium, which currently holds up to 62,547 spectators. Cruzeiro's
          regular kit colors are blue shirts and white shorts with white socks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cruzeiro is one of Brazil's most successful clubs despite its
          relatively young age (compared with other major Brazilian clubs). It
          won the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A for the first time in 1966,
          after defeating Santos' Os Santásticos in the final series.[2]
          Cruzeiro has won the Brasileirão again in 2003, 2013 and 2014,
          obtaining the best campaign in the present format of the competition.
          Cruzeiro has also won record six Copa do Brasil titles and the
          Campeonato Mineiro 39 times. Cruzeiro won the defunct state
          competitions Taça Minas Gerais five times, the Copa dos Campeões
          Mineiros twice, Copa Sul Minas twice, the Torneio Início 10 times and
          the Supercampeonato Mineiro once. A Raposa also obtained many
          international laurels such as two Copa Libertadores, two Supercopa
          Libertadores, one Recopa Sudamericana, one Copa de Oro and one Copa
          Master de Supercopa. Cruzeiro is one of the two Brazilian clubs to
          complete the Domestic Treble, a feat accomplished in 2003 after
          winning the Campeonato Mineiro, the 2003 Copa do Brasil and the 2003
          Brasileirão. Cruzeiro hold a long-standing rivalry against Atlético
          Mineiro. It has contributed many key and famous players towards
          Brazil's FIFA World Cup squads such as Piazza, Tostão, Nelinho,
          Ronaldo, Luisão, Alex, Maicon, Cris, Jairzinho, Rivaldo and Edílson
          among so many others.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Cruzeiro's history is traced back to the Italian community living in
          Belo Horizonte, a city where already some Italian immigrants lived and
          their desire to set up a football club. Similar to the Italians of São
          Paulo (who founded Palestra Itália, now known as Palmeiras) the people
          of Belo Horizonte wanted the Italian colonies in Minas Gerais to have
          its own club as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the sporting goods and footwear Augustine Ranieri's factory,
          located on the street of Caetés, it was decided the foundation of the
          club should tackle the three major capital: Atlético Mineiro,
          America-MG and Yale. Was born at that moment, the Società Sportiva
          Palestra Italia, established on 2 January 1921.
        </p>
        <p>
          The meeting was attended by 95 founders present the shield and uniform
          that made reference to the Italian colors, and whose SSPI description
          would be recorded in the center shell. Another decision was that only
          members of the Italian colony could wear the shirt. Aurelio Noce was
          elected the first President.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Palestra Italia emerged as the representative of the Italian
          colony. And is characterized as a team of Italian descent, Palestra
          also stood out by having elements of the Belo Horizonte working class,
          unlike Atlético and América, who had their consisting squad of college
          students coming from influential and wealthy families of the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea of the club being created took a big step when Yale, a sports
          team from the city, went through an administrative crisis. When some
          players left Yale over a dispute (Yale, which itself had connections
          to the Italian community), some went on to found the all Italian,
          <strong>Sociedade Esportiva Palestra Itália</strong> of Belo
          Horizonte. Until 1925 the club would only allow Italian men to
          participate, despite other teams in the nation accepting people of all
          skin colors and ethnicities.

          Palestra debuted in the Prado Mineiro Stadium with a 2–0 win in a
          friendly on 3 April 1921, against a combination from Nova Lima. The
          Nova Lima team united players from two teams from the city: Villa
          Nova, and Palmeiras, another team form Nova Lima. However, the first
          official match of Palestra was in a 3–0 win over future archrivals
          Clube Atlético Mineiro. In January 1942, Brazil entered World War II
          and a decree of the federal government forbade the use of terms from
          enemy nations in entities, institutions, establishments, etc. With
          this, the Italian name was removed and the club could no longer call
          themselves Palestra Italia. The name was changed to Sociedade
          Esportiva Palestra Mineiro.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around six months later, the president Ennes Cyro Poni called a
          general assembly for 7 October and suggested the name Ypiranga.
          Between 3 and 7 October, the local media published the new name
          thinking it would be approved. In assembly, the counselors and
          associates kept professional system and approved changing club's name
          and colors. Yale and Ypiranga were suggested, but
          <strong>Cruzeiro Esporte Clube</strong> was chosen to honor the
          biggest symbol of Brazil, the constellation of Crux. The idea was from
          Oswaldo Pinto Coelho. However, the club kept playing as "Palestra
          Mineiro" until 1943, when the local Federation approved the new
          statutes. The approved colors were blue and white, chosen as a
          compromise to appease the Italian factions within the club management,
          as it was both representative of the Brazilian flag and the Italian
          football national team (blue is the color of House of Savoy, who ruled
          Italy from 1861 to 1946).
        </p>
        <p>
          With the inauguration of the Mineirão in 1965, Cruzeiro entered one of
          the most successful periods in its history, in which the club won five
          Campeonato Mineiro titles in a row, and went on to win its first
          national title, the 1966 Taça Brasil (the highest honor in Brazilian
          football at that time) beating Santos of Pelé in the final. Cruzeiro
          won the first leg 6–2 at the Mineirão, and the second leg 3–2 in São
          Paulo. In the 1974 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A Cruzeiro were
          runner-up for the first time, after losing to Vasco in the finals.
          Later in 1975, Cruzeiro were runner-up in the Campeonato Brasileiro
          again, this time losing to Internacional. In 1976, Cruzeiro won its
          first Copa Libertadores de América, over River Plate of Argentina.
          Cruzeiro went on to be runners-up of the same competition in 1977,
          being defeated in the finals by Boca Juniors, also of Argentina. After
          winning the 1976 Copa Libertadores, they participated in the 1976
          Intercontinental Cup, now renamed the FIFA Club World Championship,
          for the first time and tied Bayern Munich 0–0 at the Mineirão, but
          lost 2–0 to Bayern in the Olympiastadion.

        </figure>
        <p>
          After tasting success in the 1960s and 1970s, Cruzeiro entered a dark
          period in the 1980s. With the exception of a couple of Campeonato
          Mineiro wins, the club won no other championships in the 1980s, and
          had its worst performances in the Campeonato Brasileiro, 33rd in 1984
          and 29th in 1985. The 1980s was the only decade Cruzeiro did not
          participate once in the Copa Libertadores since the tournament's
          creation in 1960. The club were invited to Europe in 1988 by Scottish
          side Celtic to play a friendly as part of the Glasgow club's centenary
          celebrations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 1990s a new era began, and a 15-year sequence of at least one
          title per year was initiated. This included six of the club's seven
          international championships and a Campeonato Brasileiro (2003). In
          December 2010 the CBF (the governing body of Brazilian football) also
          recognized Cruzeiro as Brazilian champion of 1966, for having beaten
          Santos of Pelé: 6–2 in Belo Horizonte and 2–3 in São Paulo. The club's
          biggest exploit in the 21st century happened when it won the
          Campeonato Brasileiro Série A. With 100 points earned during the
          season, and just over 100 goals scored in 46 matches, it was one of
          the most successful campaigns ever by a club in a Brazilian
          championship. In 2003, besides winning the Campeonato Brasileiro Série
          A, Cruzeiro also won the Copa do Brasil and the Campeonato Mineiro, to
          become the only Brazilian team to win the triple crown.
        </p>
        <p>
          From 2003 to 2012 Cruzeiro have only won one major tournament (four
          times): the Campeonato Mineiro (2004, 2006, 2008, 2009). However, the
          club finished in the top five of the Campeonato Brasileiro in 2007,
          2008, 2009 and 2010, guaranteeing a spot in the Copa Libertadores for
          four consecutive years (2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011). In 2010, after a
          great campaign in the Campeonato Brasileiro Serie A, Cruzeiro took the
          second place and qualified for the Copa Libertadores da America for
          2011. Cruzeiro's biggest success in recent years was reaching the
          finals of the 2009 Copa Libertadores, but they lost to Estudiantes de
          La Plata 2–1. After a disastrous 2011 season, escaping relegation only
          in the last round after a triumphant 6–1 against arch-rival Atlético,
          Gilvan Tavares became president for the 2012-2013-2014 triennium. 2012
          was slightly better than 2011, but still Cruzeiro won no titles. In
          2013 Cruzeiro lost Campeonato Mineiro again, despite displaying a good
          game against smaller clubs. Copa do Brasil started promising but
          Cruzeiro was knocked out by future champion Flamengo in the
          quarterfinals. After the elimination Cruzeiro went all in to
          Campeonato Brasileiro and was crowned champion for the third time,
          this time four rounds before the championship ended, playing an
          offensive and intense game that led many, including press and
          runners-up, to attribute the title many rounds before the mathematical
          confirmation. Cruzeiro's 2014 season was even more successful. It
          started with Cruzeiro winning the Campeonato Mineiro without losing a
          single match in the whole competition. In the Copa Libertadores da
          America, Cruzeiro was knocked out, in the quarter finals, by future
          champion San Lorenzo de Almagro, being the last remaining Brazilian
          team in the competition. This loss did not prevent Cruzeiro to lead
          the Campeonato Brasileiro for almost the whole competition, being
          crowned champion for the fourth time and becoming the second team not
          from Rio de Janeiro nor Sao Paulo to win the Campeonato Brasileiro
          twice in a row. Cruzeiro also got to the final of the Copa do Brasil,
          but lost both matches to rival Atlético Mineiro.

          <p>
            When Cruzeiro was still known as Palestra Italia, the home shirt
            colour was green. The first home kit was an improvised dark green
            shirt, with white shorts and green stockings. Cruzeiro used this kit
            in their first professional game on 3 April 1921, in the Prado
            Mineiro Stadium, with a 2–0 win over the Villa Nova/Palmeiras
            combined team, of Nova Lima. In 1928 the shirt became a lighter tone
            of green, with a white neck design and red cuffs. The shorts
            continued to be white, but the green stockings now had red and white
            details, similar to that of the Italian flag. This particular
            uniform was used up until 1940. The light green color of the shirt
            would later give the team the nickname "periquito", Portuguese for
            parakeet. In 1940 there was a big change to the shirt. The shirt
            began to feature horizontal stripes, with the club crest in the
            center. This was the shirt used to win the 1940 Campeonato da Cidade
            – now known as the Campeonto Mineiro – after the club had been
            unable to win the tournament for ten years. The club also began to
            be called "tricolor" instead of "periquito".
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1942 Cruzeiro played one game under the name Ypiranga, and for
            this game a blue shirt with a central horizontal stripe was used. In
            1943 Cruzeiro played its first game under its current name. The
            shirt used then was an all blue shirt with a large white v-neck
            (scapular) design. The shorts and stockings were white. In 1950, due
            to bad stadium lighting, Cruzeiro began to use an all-white shirt
            during night games. The shirt, which featured blue details and blue
            shorts and white stockings, was used for nine years. In 1956,
            Cruzeiro used, for a short while, a new shirt that was made up of
            white and blue horizontal stripes. The uniform was not used in many
            games. There was a change to the shirt in 1959; the shirt became all
            blue, a design that would influence later shirts. In the 1959 shirt,
            instead of using its normal crest Cruzeiro simply used the five
            stars, in the crest, loose on the shirt. The shirt made its debut in
            the Estádio dos Tecelões, in a friendly match against Renascença, on
            19 September.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1984 Cruzeiro had the first ever company logo on its shirt; it
            was the shirt manufacturer's logo, which was Topper. In the same
            year Cruzeiro had its first shirt sponsor, Medradao. Medradao was
            only used on the away shirts.

        <section id="crest">
          <h3>Crest</h3>
          <p>
            The first Palestra Itália crest was a rhombus whose top half was red
            and bottom half was green (both colors of the Italian flag). In the
            center of the crest was a white circle with the letters P and I
            inside it. The following year, 1922, the club's crest maintained its
            rhombus shape, but was now completely white, with the letter P, S
            and I, inscribed within it in green. In 1923, the crest lost its
            rhombus shape and instead just had the green letters S, P and I.
            From 1928 to 1939 the crest was identical to the first crest in
            1921. Just one year later the crest became a little different: the
            top half was green and the bottom half was red, similar to the
            crests from 1921 and 1929–1939, but instead of green letters in its
            center, it now had the letters S, P and I in yellow.
          </p>
          <p>
            The crest introduced in 1940 would be the last for Palestra, because
            the club would soon become Cruzeiro. Cruzeiro's first crest was
            introduced in 1950 and was very simple: a blue circle, with a white
            border, inside of which were five white stars, positioned to look
            like the Southern Cross. This first crest was used for over nine
            years, until 1959. In 1959 the crest changed, now with a white
            border around the crest with the words "-CRUZEIRO ESPORTE CLUBE-BELO
            HORIZONTE" in blue. This version of the crest was used until 1996,
            making it the longest-used crest by Cruzeiro. In the same year,
            Cruzeiro removed BELO HORIZONTE from the crest; this format was used
            until 2005. In 2006 to honor its successful 2003 season, a crown was
            added on top of the crest, to symbolize the triple crown.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cruzeiro has not always used its official crest on its shirt. In
            1959, instead of using its crest, the club opted to simply put the
            five stars from the Southern Cross on its shirt. This was done until
            2000, when the actual crest was again used. In 2002 and in part of
            2003 the loose stars were used. Part way through 2003 a new shirt
            that contained the actual crest was introduced, but instead of just
            using the regular crest the shirt featured two Copa Libertadores
            trophies on top of the crest. In 2004 a similar design was used, but
            now featured a crown, symbolic of the Triple Crown on top of the two
            trophies. Since 2007 the club has used the "loose stars" design on
            home shirts. None of these designs actually became the official club
            crest.

          <h3>Anthem</h3>
          <p>
            The club's anthem, Hino ao Campeão, was written by Jadir Ambrósio in
            1966, in homage to the team of his heart. He never meant for it to
            become the official anthem, but when fans started hearing it they
            liked it enough to adapt it as the new anthem.

          <h3>Mascot</h3>
          <p>
            Cartoonist Fernando Pieruccetti, more popularly known as "Mangabeira", created the club's mascot, a raposa (Portuguese for fox) in the 1940s, as he did for other football clubs from Minas Gerais state league. Mangabeira took inspiration from the club's ex-president, Mario Grosso. "He was a director who let no one trick him. He was sly, agile, intelligent and skillful like a fox." In the 2000s, Cruzeiro has made the Raposão (Big Fox) its biggest mascot, appearing at all home games and cheering with the crowd while wearing the club's colors. In 2010, Raposão won Rede Globo's Competição de Mascotes (Mascot Competition), held in their Sunday sports show Esporte Espetacular. The program united 20 mascots from the biggest Brazilian teams and had them competing in series of challenges. Raposão won all of the events and was crowned as Brazil's Best Mascot.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2012, Cruzeiro introduced a "junior mascot", named "Raposinho" (Little Fox), a smaller version of "Raposão".

            The player with the most appearances for Cruzeiro is Fábio with a stunning record of 800 appearances, having been with the team since 2005, beating former midfielder Zé Carlos, with 619 appearances, between 1965 and 1977. In third place on that list is 1971's Bola de Ouro Winner, "The Prince" Dirceu Lopes, while the fourth place belongs to former Brazilian international and 1970 FIFA World Cup champion Wilson Piazza. The fifth overall player, and second goalkeeper with the most appearances for Cruzeiro is the notorious Raul Plassman, who played a total of 557 games with the team.

            Brazilian hall-of-famer and 1970 FIFA World Cup winner Tostão has scored the most goals for Cruzeiro, 249 between 1963 and 1972, having appeared on 378 matches for Cruzeiro (12th overall). He beats Dirceu Lopes by 25 goals on that list, which also has old-timer Niginho (207 goals) closing the top 3, being the only ones with over 200 goals for Cruzeiro. Ninão holds the record for goals scored in a single match: 10 in Cruzeiro's 14–0 win over Alves Nogueira during Campeonato da Cidade on 17 June 1928. Nelinho holds the record for most goals scored from penalties: 38; and the record for goals scored from fouls: 42. Walter Montillo's 39 goals make him the non-Brazilian with the most goals for Cruzeiro, a record that would belong to Bolivia national football team vice-captain and striker Marcelo Moreno with 48 goals or Spanish 1930's striker Fernando Carazo, with 44 goals, had they not become Brazilian nationals.

          Cruzeiro's first stadium was the Estádio do Prado Mineiro, which belonged to the Federação Mineira de Futebol (FMF).[36] The club's first game at the stadium was 2–0 win over a Villa Nova/Palmeiras combine team from Nova Lima on 3 April 1921. Cruzeiro would use the stadium until 1923 when the club built its own stadium, Estádio do Barro Preto. On 23 July 1923, Cruzeiro debuted at the stadium in a 2–2 tie with Flamengo. In 1945, the stadium went through renovations and would become at that time the largest stadium in the state with a capacity of 15,000 and later on would become known as Estádio Juscelino Kubitscheck (or Estádio JK). Cruzeiro would use the stadium until 1965, when the Mineirão was opened. In 1983, the stadium was torn down and one of the club's social clubs (Sede Campestre) was built there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 1965, Cruzeiro play their home games at Estádio Governador Magalhães Pinto, often referred to as just Mineirão in Belo Horizonte, MG. Cruzeiro shares the stadium with rivals Atlético Mineiro. The stadium does not belong to Cruzeiro, rather it belongs to the state of Minas Gerais (through a land grant from the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais) and is administrated by Minas Arena, a private company, on lease from the state since 2013. The stadium, which was built in 1963, had an original capacity of about 130,000, but over the years that capacity has been reduced, and currently it seats 64,800. Named after former Minas Gerais governor José de Magalhães Pinto, it took over 4,000 workers to build the stadium. The period after the stadium's inauguration is often called Era Mineirão ("Mineirão Era"), which saw Cruzeiro gain national and international prominence. Cruzeiro also holds the attendance record at the stadium, when 132,834 spectators watched Cruzeiro beat Villa Nova in the 1997 Campeonato Mineiro final.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cruzeiro have had plans to build a new stadium, especially under president Alvimar de Oliveira Costa's tenure. However, the state of Minas asked Cruzeiro to stay at the stadium, and after president Zezé Perrella came to the presidency in 2009, plans for a new stadium virtually disappeared.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mineirão was selected as a host stadium for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, with renovations beginning on 25 June 2010, and projected to be completed by December 2012. After the stadiums closing, Cruzeiro began playing home games at the Arena do Jacaré and Ipatingão stadiums, both outside the city of Belo Horizonte. Independência stadium is also being renovated and Cruzeiro will start playing homes games there in 2011 until the Mineirão is ready in 2012.
        </p>
        <p>
          The club has private ownership of other facilities though, including two training facilities (Toca da Raposa I, which serves the youth division and Toca da Raposa II for the senior squad), an administrative headquarters and two social club facilities. Cruzeiro has often been praised for having one of the leading infrastructure systems in Brazil.
